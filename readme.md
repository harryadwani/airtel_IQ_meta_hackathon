Airtel IQ - Meta Hackathon 2022 project on WhatsApp API integrations to improve business reach.
BERT-SQuAD folder contains an ML model + Flask API which takes as input a text or pdf file along with a user question. Output is simply the BERT generated possible answer of the input question.
ElixirAPI folder contains whatsapp business related APIs which are connected to the custom APIs and models described previously.
I would update more steps on running the project shortly.
